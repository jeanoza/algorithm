# Algorithm Repository

## Object

- [ ] This repository is to study & resolve exercices with languages of computer science which I've studied until now : Python, Java, C, Javascript.
- [ ] Studying only framework seems a method that make programer depend on framework and lose his autonomicity. Thanks to this exercice, i could not only forget my languages studied but also progress my problem-solving ability in computer science.
- [ ] Exercice everyday(even a little bit of time) in this site(korean) : https://programmers.co.kr/

## Divde Directories & Modality

- [ ] Directories : C, Python, Java, Javascript
- [ ] Sub-Directories : level1, level2 ...

### Concentration for JavaScript

- I changed my opinion : in this time, i think that concentrating in JS, whom I wanna master(?) in this time, is better for do not be confused because i'm still beginer in programming.
